# Data Science for water consumption forecasting and anomaly detection

I used a Jupyter notebook to do this work. If you want to run it, you have to install the following library for python: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, prophet, seaborn, matplotlib and jupyterlab.

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn prophet seaborn matplotlib jupyterlab
```

I also added the PDF version of my notebook in case the .ipynb is not easily readable on GitHub.
